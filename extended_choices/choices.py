class Choices:
    """
    Helper to easily create objects for use with the "choices" parameter
    for models fields.

    Default call exemple, with n tuples(constant name, value, string)

        CHOICES_A = Choices(
            ('THE_A_1', 11, u'a_1'),
            ('THE_A_2', 12, u'a_2'),
        )

    Default call create, for CHOICES_A :
     * all named constant (THE_A_1 and THE_A_2)
     * a tuple CHOICES ( (11, u'a_1'), (12, u'a_2') )
     * a dict CHOICES_DICT { 11 => u'a_1', 12 => u'a_2' }
     * a dict CHOICES_REVERTED { u'a_1' => 11, u'a_2' => 12 }

    If you want all these names not to contain "CHOICES" but an other name,
    you can add it to the call :

        CHOICES_A = Choices(
            ('THE_A_1', 11, u'a_1'),
            ('THE_A_2', 12, u'a_2'),
            name = 'FOO'
        )

    This exemple will create all constants (no changes here), and FOO will
    be used in place of CHOICES, and FOO_DICT and FOO_REVERTED in place of
    CHOICES_DICT and CHOICES_REVERTED

    If you want to create other choices for the same instance, you can
    use the add_choices method
    This method take a name (to use in place of "CHOICES" in all variable
    names), and then all the tuples like in the constructor

        CHOICES_A.add_choices('BAR',
            ('THE_A_1', 11, 'a_1_bis'),
            ('THE_A_2', 13, 'a_3'),
        )

    This exemple will create all constants (except for those which already
    exists : we don't create them and ignore the value as we get the one for
    the existed constant), here just THE_A_2,  and add BAR, BAR_DICT and
    REVERTED_BAR_DICT
